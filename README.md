# Aundrae Allison, Tamas Toth - SMU Case study brewery analysis

## MSDS 6306: Doing Data Science

Description

The Beers dataset contains a list of 2410 US craft beers and Breweries
dataset contains 558 US breweries. The datasets descriptions are as
follows.

**Beers.csv:**

-   Name: Name of the beer.
-   Beer_ID: Unique identifier of the beer.
-   ABV: Alcohol by volume of the beer.
-   IBU: International Bitterness Units of the beer.
-   Brewery_ID: Brewery id associated with the beer.
-   Style: Style of the beer.
-   Ounces: Ounces of beer.

**Breweries.csv:**

-   Brew_ID: Unique identifier of the brewery.
-   Name: Name of the brewery.
-   City: City where the brewery is located.
-   State: U.S. State where the brewery is located.

Intention is to answer the below questions through Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Modeling to halp the company to drive potential business advantage.


Analysis Questions:

1.  How many breweries are present in each state?

2.  Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6
    observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.
    (RMD only, this does not need to be included in the presentation or
    the deck.)

3.  Address the missing values in each column.

4.  Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit
    for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.

5.  Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has
    the most bitter (IBU) beer?

6.  Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV
    variable.

7.  Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer
    and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot. Make your best
    judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.

8.  Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect
    to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale
    (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA). You decide to use
    KNN classification to investigate this relationship. Provide
    statistical evidence one way or the other. You can of course assume
    your audience is comfortable with percentages … KNN is very easy to
    understand conceptually.

In addition, while you have decided to use KNN to investigate this
relationship (KNN is required) you may also feel free to supplement your
response to this question with any other methods or techniques you have
learned. Creativity and alternative solutions are always encouraged.

1.  Knock their socks off! Find one other useful inference from the data
    that you feel Budweiser may be able to find value in. You must
    convince them why it is important and back up your conviction with
    appropriate statistical evidence.


2.  Codebook, Both CSV files and a ReadMe.md The Readme file describes
    the purpose of the project and codebook. The repo can be structured
    however you like, but it should make sense and be easily navigated.
